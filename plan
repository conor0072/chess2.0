Problem-Solving Plan

Step 1: Setup and Planning
Decide the key features: legal moves, dragging animation, AI difficulty
Plan for state handling: board array, turn tracking, castling flags
Design the UI with home screen, in-game board, and game-over display

Step 2: Base Game Engine
Use a nested list to represent the board
Implement a piece movement system with full rule validation
Create rendering logic for board and pieces with smooth animations

Step 3: User Interface
Add interactive buttons for selecting game mode
Highlight last move and show legal moves

Step 4: AI Integration
Connect Stockfish engine via python-stockfish wrapper
Use FEN string conversion for AI communication
Allow different difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)

Step 5: Advanced Chess Mechanics
Implement castling rules with checks for safe paths and rook movement
Add pawn promotion popup for piece selection
Highlight kings in check
